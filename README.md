# Hotword Enrollment Blobs Nuker (nuker) #


### What is this ? ###

Basically Fluid on miatoll seems to be struggling with hotword enrollment blobs as they cause issues on curtana devices, I think also they seem to be causing lag issues and they seem to crash media server on such devices, hence why this exists, until R firmware is released for such devices, this will be the defacto fix 

### Why is this ? ###

This is made possible by ```blockdev```. 

You can run the commands manually, but most people are lazy like me (& Henlo) so he made a zip :p 

### Proof of the zip working ###

The zip has been tested on henlo's device, curtana.
